Chest Tracker v2.5.0 for Minecraft versions 1.21.1, 1.20.4 and 1.20.1.

Along with new translations, there are several feature improvements:

## Unpack Nested

Items within shulker boxes, bundles and similar items will now be unpacked 
and shown on the item list.

## Ender Chest & related handling improvements

- Ender Chests will now be tracked correctly from the common commands `/enderchest`, 
`/ec`, `/echest` or `/ender`. 
- Additionally, command-opened menus will no longer cause
ghost memories.
- Shulker Box Tooltip integration will now show the proper layout of your ender chest.

## Name Rendering adjustments

Container names now have an option to only render when your cursor is over the container;
this may be preferable if you use stacked chests.
