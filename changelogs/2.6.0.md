## Chest Tracker v2.6.0 for Minecraft versions 1.21.1, 1.20.4 and 1.20.1.

Notable changes since 2.5:

- Where Is It update: now refresh highlights by pressing `[ Y ]` again, in case it wasn't long enough.
- Litematica integration:
  - Quick-search buttons added to the material lists
  - Saved Ender Chest memories are now counted towards the material list
  - Nearby containers can be counted towards the material list (disabled by default)
- Updated block integrity, will no longer forget blocks from certain mods being immediately forgot
- Expanded Storage compat:
  - Now detects linked blocks properly

I don't use Litematica myself, so feel free to suggest any further improvements.
